4,Which realm encompasses all freshwater bodies on Earth's surface?," The realm that encompasses all freshwater bodies on Earth's surface is called the ""hydrosphere.""",6.027061462402344,Terrestrial Hydrosphere
5,What is the main cause of ocean currents?," The main cause of ocean currents is the movement of the Earth's rotation and its gravitational force on the ocean floor, which creates a system of global circulation that distributes heat energy and nutrients across the world's oceans.",9.761648654937744,Wind and Earth's rotation
6,Which phenomenon describes the trapping of heat in the Earth's atmosphere?, The greenhouse effect.,4.676739931106567,Greenhouse effect
7,What term refers to the study of Earth's physical structure and substance?, Geology.,4.1175007820129395,Geology
8,What natural process breaks down rocks into soil and minerals?," Weathering is the natural process that breaks down rocks into soil and minerals. This occurs when wind, water, ice, or other natural forces act on rock surfaces, causing chemical reactions that result in the formation of new soil and minerals.",11.561551332473755,Weathering
9,Which gas is most commonly associated with volcanic eruptions?, Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most commonly associated gas with volcanic eruptions.,5.826773405075073,Carbon dioxide
10,What is the primary source of energy driving the water cycle?," The water cycle is driven by solar radiation, which heats up the Earth's surface and causes water to evaporate and rise into the atmosphere as water vapor. This water vapor then forms clouds and eventually falls back to the Earth as precipitation, which can take many forms such as rain, snow, sleet or hail.",13.098798274993896,The Sun
11,Which human activity is a major contributor to deforestation?," Logging and agriculture are the two main drivers of deforestation, with logging being responsible for around 50% of global forest loss.",7.009565591812134,Agriculture
12,"What term describes the seasonal movement of water through precipitation, infiltration, and runoff?"," The term that describes the seasonal movement of water through precipitation, infiltration, and runoff is ""water cycle"".",7.20798921585083,Water cycle
13,Which chemical element is most abundant in the Earth's crust?," The chemical element that is most abundant in the Earth's crust is oxygen (O), which makes up about 46% of the crust by weight.",9.09842324256897,Oxygen
14,What is the process of water changing from a liquid to a gas called?, The process of water changing from a liquid to a gas is known as evaporation.,7.265585660934448,Evaporation
15,Which layer of soil contains the highest concentration of organic matter?," The topsoil layer contains the highest concentration of organic matter due to its continuous growth and development over time, as well as the presence of microorganisms that break down organic matter.",9.287598371505737,Topsoil
16,What term is used for large-scale weather patterns that last several weeks to months?, Seasonal climate pattern.,4.9561381340026855,Climate phenomena

18,What type of ecosystem is dominated by grasses rather than large shrubs or trees?, Grassland ecosystem.,4.5543529987335205,Grassland
19,Which natural process leads to the gradual warming of Earth's surface?, The natural process that leads to the gradual warming of Earth's surface is the greenhouse effect.,6.31708550453186,Global warming
20,What is the main source of carbon dioxide emissions from human activities?," The main source of carbon dioxide emissions from human activities is burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production.",7.485680341720581,Fossil fuel combustion
21,What is the main factor causing seasonal changes on Earth?," The main factor causing seasonal changes on Earth is the tilt of its axis, which causes variations in the amount of sunlight that reaches different parts of the planet at different times of year. This results in differences in temperature and weather patterns, as well as changes in plant life cycles and animal migration patterns.",12.752711057662964,The tilt of Earth's axis
